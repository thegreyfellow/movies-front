# A Small Movies Search UI
## Description
This is a small movies search UI that uses an API to fetch movies data and display it in an ergonomic way (but really, it's just an excuse to do React Router and React Table latest versions).

## How to run
- you will need to run two commands:
  - `npm install` to install the dependencies
  - `npm run dev` to start the dev environment

## Stack used
- React v18
- React Router v6
- Tanstack/React Table v8
- swr (useSWR hook) v2
- vite v4
- Eslint
- Prettier

## Feedback
I'm always open to feedback, so if you have any, please feel free to open an issue or a PR.
